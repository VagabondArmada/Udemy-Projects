      <li><strong>Why do I want to learn this skill? What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</strong></li>
      <p>Learning web development is a way for me to access untapped potential. My sense for critical thinking and problem solving are underutilized in my current workspace. I hope to find a career path that is more fulfilling to me personally and supports a lifestyle that is financially stable.</p>
      <li><strong>What will I achieve if I learn this skill? Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more?</strong></li>
      <p>If I pursue a career in web development, I have the potential to work remotely and travel more.</p>
      <li><strong>How will this skill change my life and my career? Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?</strong></li>
      <p>Learning web development would give me an exit out of working in the food service industry. Being a bartender is socially draining and has a glass ceiling. Tech careers are in higher demand and allow for more room to grow.</p>
      <li><strong>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers? What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?</strong></li>
      <p>Learning web development would place me in a workforce that makes more sense for my personality - one that I could flourish in. In turn, my friends and family would see me happier as I'm create a life with purpose.</p>
      <li><strong>How will I feel if I never accomplish this? Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</strong></li>
      <p>If I don't find a more suitable career, I'll feel like I coasted through life rather than pushed myself to make the most of what I have.</p>
      <li><strong>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this? Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?</strong></li>
      <p>If I achieve a career in web development, I see myself being able to support myself financially, being able to adopt/raise a child, saving money to take care of my parents, creating a way to work remotely while developing an AirBNB property.</p>
